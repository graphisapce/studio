# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication. To connect your Firebase project, you need to provide your project's configuration:

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.local.example` into your new `.env.local` file.
3.  Go to your Firebase project settings, find your web app's configuration, and copy the values into `.env.local`.

Once you save the file, the app will connect to your Firebase project.
