     * LOCALVYAPAR SECURITY RULES
     *
     * CORE PHILOSOPHY:
     * This ruleset implements an ownership-based security model designed for a marketplace 
     * environment. It balances the need for public discoverability of businesses and products 
     * with strict write-access controls to ensure only authorized owners can modify their data.
     *
     * DATA STRUCTURE:
     * - /users/{userId}: Private user profiles accessible only by the individual user.
     * - /businesses/{businessId}: Publicly readable business profiles. Ownership is 
     *   determined by a denormalized 'ownerId' field.
     * - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product listings. Ownership is determined 
     *   by a 'businessId' field, which links back to the business owner.
     *
     * KEY SECURITY DECISIONS:
     * 1. Public Read Access: Businesses and products are publicly listable to allow 
     *    unauthenticated users to browse the marketplace.
     * 2. Strict User Segregation: User profile data is restricted to the specific owner 
     *    to protect PII (Phone, Email).
     * 3. Relational Integrity: The rules enforce that 'ownerId' and 'businessId' fields 
     *    remain immutable once set to prevent "ownership hijacking."
     *
     * DENORMALIZATION FOR AUTHORIZATION:
     * - Businesses contain an 'ownerId' to allow the rules to check ownership 
     *   without performing a join on the users collection.
     * - Products contain a 'businessId'. Authorization for product modification 
     *   requires a lookup (get) on the associated business document to verify the 
     *   user's ownership of that business.
